1. First, write a brief summary of the changes you want to post. Keep it concise but informative. Include:
   - What was changed
   - Why it was changed
   - Any important technical details

2. Use the Slack MCP to post the message to #change-log-demo:
   ```javascript
   mcp1_slack_post_message({
     channel_id: "change-log-demo",
     text: "ðŸ”„ *Application Update*\n\n[Your change summary here]"
   })
   ```

Example usage:
```javascript
mcp1_slack_post_message({
  channel_id: "change-log-demo",
  text: "ðŸ”„ *Application Update*\n\nâ€¢ Added new book checkout validation\nâ€¢ Implemented rate limiting for API endpoints\nâ€¢ Fixed bug in patron registration flow"
})
```

Note: Make sure your message follows these best practices:
